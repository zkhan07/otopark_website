Cookies can also help us provide information which is\r\n            targeted to Your interests. Cookies may be used to identify logged\r\n            in or registered users. <br />\r\n            <br /> 5.2. Third-party vendors including www.google.com may use\r\n            cookies to serve ads based on your visits to otopark platform. You\r\n            may visit the website of the third party and choose to opt-out of\r\n            the use of cookies for interest-based advertising if the third party\r\n            offers such an option.

Due to the existing regulatory environment, We cannot ensure\r\n            that all of Your Personal Information shall never be disclosed in\r\n            ways other than those described in this Privacy Policy. Although We\r\n            use industry-standard practices to protect your privacy, We do not\r\n            promise, and You should not expect, that Your personally\r\n            identifiable information or private communications would always\r\n            remain private. <br />\r\n            <br /> i. Other Corporate Entities: We share much of our data,\r\n            including Your Personal Information with Our parent and/or\r\n            subsidiaries that are committed to serving Your needs through the\r\n            use of otopark services. Such data shall be shared for the sole\r\n            purpose of enhancing Your experience of using the Platform. To the\r\n            extent that these entities have access to your information, they\r\n            shall treat it at least as protective as they treat information they\r\n            obtain from their other members. It is possible that We and/or Our\r\n            subsidiaries, or any combination of such, could merge with or be\r\n            acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination\r\n            occur, you should expect that we would share some or all of your\r\n            information in order to continue to provide the service. You shall\r\n            receive notice of such an event (to the extent it occurs).\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br /> ii. Law and order: We cooperate with law enforcement\r\n            inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as\r\n            intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can, and\r\n            You so authorize Us, disclose your personal information to law\r\n            enforcement and other government officials as We, in our sole\r\n            discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an\r\n            investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or\r\n            other activity that is illegal or may expose Us or You to any legal\r\n            liability. <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            7.2. Any information that you make publicly available on the\r\n            platform may be potentially viewed by any party, and by posting such\r\n            material it is deemed that you consent to share such information\r\n            with such parties.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <h4> Accessing, Reviewing and Changing your profile</h4>\r\n            <br />\r\n            8.1. Following registration, you can review and change the\r\n            information You submitted at the stage of registration, except Your\r\n            display name/user name. An option for facilitating such change shall\r\n            be present on the platforms and such change shall be facilitated by\r\n            the User, if you change any information, we may keep track of Your\r\n            old information.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            8.2. We shall retain in Our files, the information You have\r\n            requested to remove for certain circumstances, such as to resolve\r\n            disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and\r\n            conditions. Further, such prior information is never completely\r\n            removed from our database due to technical and legal constraints,\r\n            including stored ‘back up’ systems. Therefore, You should not expect\r\n            that all of Your personally identifiable information shall be\r\n            completely removed from our databases in response to Your requests.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <h4> Security</h4>\r\n            <br />\r\n            9.1. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss\r\n            and unauthorized access. We employ many different security\r\n            techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members\r\n            inside and outside otopark. We follow generally accepted industry\r\n            standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to Us and\r\n            information that we have accessed. However, “perfect security” does\r\n            not exist on the internet. You, therefore, agree that any security\r\n            breaches beyond the control of our standard security procedures are\r\n            at Your sole risk and discretion.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <h4> Indemnity</h4>\r\n            <br /> 10.1. You agree and undertake to indemnify Us in any suit or\r\n            dispute by any third party arising out of disclosure of personal\r\n            information by You to third parties either through the platform or\r\n            otherwise and Your use and access of websites, websites and\r\n            resources of third parties. We assume no liability for any actions\r\n            of third parties with regard to Your personal information, which You\r\n            may have disclosed to such third parties.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <h4>Severability</h4>\r\n            <br />\r\n            11.1. Each paragraph of this privacy policy shall be and remain\r\n            separate from and independent of and severable from all and any\r\n            paragraphs herein except where otherwise expressly indicated or\r\n            indicated by the context of the agreement. The decisions or\r\n            declaration that one or more of the paragraphs are null and void\r\n            shall have no effect on the remaining paragraphs of this privacy\r\n            policy.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <h4> Amendment</h4>\r\n            <br />\r\n            12.1. Our privacy policy may change from time to time. Hence We\r\n            shall post any privacy policy change on Our platform or notify You\r\n            by email.\r\n          </div>\r\n          <Footer />\r\n        </Grid>\r\n      </Grid>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\nexport default Host;\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
